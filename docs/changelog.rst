Changelog
==========


Version 0.6
-----------

* Admin integration has been simplified.  It became less hacky and therefore
  fixed lots of issues.
* Admin integration of a foreign key to a child polymorphic model is fully
  working.
* Full django-grappelli compatibility.
* **Changed** ``PolymorphicParentModelAdmin.child_models`` is now a tuple
  of Models.  Before it was a tuple of (Model, ModelAdmin) tuples.
* **Changed** Child models now have to be registered to the admin site.

If you already use the admin integration, you therefore have to:

* Change

  .. code-block:: python

      child_models = ((ModelA, ModelAChildAdmin), (ModelB, ModelBChildAdmin))

  to

  .. code-block:: python

      child_models = (ModelA, ModelB)

* Register the child models in the classical way:

  .. code-block:: python

      admin.site.register(ModelA, ModelAChildAdmin)
      admin.site.register(ModelB, ModelBChildAdmin)

See :ref:`the admin example <admin-example>` for more details.


Version 0.5.4 (in development)
------------------------------

* Fix ``.non_polymorphic()`` to returns a clone of the queryset, instead of effecting the existing queryset.
* Fix missing ``alters_data = True`` annotations on the overwritten ``save()`` methods.
* Fix infinite recursion bug in the admin with Django 1.6+


Version 0.5.3 (2013-09-17)
--------------------------

* Fix TypeError when ``base_form`` was not defined.
* Fix passing ``/admin/app/model/id/XYZ`` urls to the correct admin backend.
  There is no need to include a ``?ct_id=..`` field, as the ID already provides enough information.


Version 0.5.2 (2013-09-05)
--------------------------

* Fix Grappelli_ breadcrumb support in the views.
* Fix unwanted ``___`` handling in the ORM when a field name starts with an underscore;
  this detects you meant ``relatedfield__ _underscorefield`` instead of ``ClassName___field``.
* Fix missing permission check in the "add type" view. This was caught however in the next step.
* Fix admin validation errors related to additional non-model form fields.
